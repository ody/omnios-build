SUMMARY="A network tool for managing many disparate systems"
DESC="Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files."
